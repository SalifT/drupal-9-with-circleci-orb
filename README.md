# Experimental Repo For Running Drupal 9 with Pantheon Build Tools

This repository is a stripped down version of the fuller pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer which shows how Drupal 8 can be run on Pantheon with various git hosts and CI services using Pantheon's Build Tools. This repo shows only GitHub + Pantheon and uses the Pantheon CircleCI Orb.

At this point this repository is meant for experimentation only.
